# Portfolio-Project---Dad-joke-generator

Push the big button and receive your dad joke of the day. :-)

As part of the Codecademy Full-Stack-Engineering course, this is my first personal project using JavaScript. That being said
I was not required to use any HTML or CSS, however felt it was warranted and wished to try my hand with some experimentation
with crossing programming languages.
This took about 2 hours to complete, and went rather smoothly. ALthough learning how to produce a readable result on the webpage
after pressing a button was a challenge.
A I look back over the original assignment I now realize that I probably should have completed this in an entirely different way,
however I had fun, and look forward to creating many more interactive webpages.

Til next time,

Robert Pinney
