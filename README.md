# Portfolio-Project---Dad-joke-generator

Push the big button and receive your dad joke of the day!

As part of the Codecademy Full-Stack-Engineering course, this was my first project using JavaScript. I was not required to 
use HTML or CSS, however felt it was warranted and wished to try my hand with some cross language experimentation.
This took about 2 hours, and went rather smoothly, although learning how to produce a readable result was a challenge.
As I look back over the original assignment I realize I probably should have completed this in an entirely different way,
however I had fun, and look forward to creating many more interactive webpages.

Til next time,

Robert Pinney
